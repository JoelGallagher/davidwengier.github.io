### Hi!

I'm not really good at this sort of thing. I guess I like Lego and C# and writing code and thinking about development. And my wife and kids. And dog. :dog:

I'm "ch00k" on Twitter, and every other platform I can get in early enough to to claim the username on. Sometimes I add an underscore if necessary. Its a cruel world that makes you replace O's with 0's and _still_ requires the addition of an underscore. I started using the name back on a BBS system in the late 90's (what up 1647!) but I can't remember why I picked it (though yes, originally it was just "chook"), and no it doesn't mean anything. And yes I should probably grow up and stop using it. Or use my photo as an avatar. Adulting is hard.

Also I'm Australian and I love Australia but GitHub doesn't have the Australian flag emoji so you'll have to take my word for it.

<sup>Wait, was I supposed to write that in 3rd person?</sup>

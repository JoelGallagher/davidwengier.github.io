So this is new. A Jekyll blog running on GitHub Pages mapped via DNS to my domain name. I'm basically a networking engineer now.

With thanks to [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)!

(This is the first post here.. I just imported one old post from an old blog, below. Don't worry, it'll be fine.)
